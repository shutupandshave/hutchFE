# Adminportal

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 10.1.0.

## Development process
I installed and am using bootstrap as a general framework/library to save myself writing some CSS.

I changed the site to use SCSS instead of CSS.

Honestly, if I was doing this for real, I'd then use the next hour to plan without writing any code but that's not going to help you at all. 

First thing I am going to tackle is oauth.  I decided on that because I was just writing some oauth for another home app I was developing, that said in this instance we're just mocking a token and storing it.


## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
